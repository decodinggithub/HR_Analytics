# HR_Analytics
For my HR analytics project, I downloaded HR data from Kaggle in the form of a CSV file (HR_Analytics.csv). This dataset included various attributes related to employees, such as age, attrition status, department, job satisfaction, and more. The data was then processed into a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient storage and easy accessibility for further analysis.

Using Metabase, I created comprehensive visualizations and dashboards to analyze employee attrition trends. This involved examining factors like job satisfaction, work-life balance, years at the company, and other relevant metrics. The analysis provided valuable insights into the underlying causes of employee turnover, helping to develop strategies to improve retention rates and enhance overall workforce management. The project emphasized skills in data visualization, data analysis, and business analysis, enabling the generation of detailed weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports to inform strategic decision-making.
